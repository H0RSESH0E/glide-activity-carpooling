## Description

A carpooling app that helps drivers and passengers select activities. Users can signup and login to create or request rides to carpool to their selected activity. Users are able to meet new people as well as reduce their traveling costs.

## User Story

As a user I want to choose an activity and quickly look for other people also interested in the same activity. If I have a car or not I want to do the activity. I want to know the location of the activity so that I can calculate the distance of my trip to make it fun and affordable.

## Features

## Technology Used

- **Git:** Version control system to track changes to source code.

- **GitHub:** Hosts repository that can be deployed to GitHub Pages.

- **Node.js:** Used for package managment and to execute JavaScript code to build the command line tool for server-side scripting.

- **Express.js:** Express. js is a Node. js web application server framework, designed for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications. Used in this application to set middle ware for end point connection between the front end and backend.

- **Express.js Session:** is an Express.js middleware that uses sessions, a mechanism that helps applications to determine whether multiple requests came from the same client.

- **Handlebars.js:** is a logicless templating language that keeps the View and the code separate and compiles templates into JavaScript functions. It’s an extension to the Mustache templating language.

- **Sequelize:** Sequelize is an easy-to-use and promise-based Node.js ORM tool for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, and IBM i. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.

- **Sequelize Connect Session:** provides applications with a scalable store for sessions. The express-session package’s default server-side session storage, MemoryStore, is purposely not designed for a production environment, will leak memory under most conditions, doesn’t scale past a single process, and is only meant for debugging and developing. The connect-session-sequelize package resolves these issues and is compatible with the Sequelize ORM.

- **MySQL2:** is a MySQL client for Node.js with a focus on performance. This npm package allows developers to connect Node.js applications to a MySQL database.

- **Dotenv:** Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a . env file into process. env . Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

- **Bcrypt:** is a Node.js library that allows you to hash passwords. Hashing is the process of taking input and using a mathematical formula to chop and mix it up to produce an output of a specific length. Hashing is a one-way function, meaning that it can easily convert input to a fixed-size output, but it is difficult to invert, or convert in the opposite direction. This attribute allows developers to secure passwords when authenticating users for their applications.

- **Nodemon:** is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

- **JawsDB Add-On:** is a Heroku add-on that provides a fully functional MySQL database server for use with your Heroku application. For the our purposes, you’ll use the free Kitefin Shared pricing plan.

- **Faker:** is an npm package that generates massive amounts of fake contextual data.
